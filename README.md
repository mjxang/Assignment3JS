I found a really useful online resource that walked me through the process of creating this interactive quiz from https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/161/build-a-quiz-application-with-html-css-and-javascript-step-by-step-guide#google_vignette

It was pretty straightforward and I found a site that gave me random trivia questions so I used those to make the quiz pretty simple. 

The only difficulty I had was trying to implement a progress bar, and even though I tried and got the shape of the bar into my quiz, there was an issue with it not moving in sync upon completing each question.

So as a result, I opted to do a question counter instead which worked and saved me from banging my head against the wall.
